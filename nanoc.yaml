# Do not edit unless you know what you're doing! :-)


# A list of file extensions that nanoc will consider to be textual rather than
# binary. If an item with an extension not in this list is found,  the file
# will be considered as binary.
text_extensions: [ 'coffee', 'css', 'erb', 'haml', 'handlebars', 'hb', 'htm', 'html', 'js', 'less', 'markdown', 'md', 'ms', 'mustache', 'php', 'rb', 'sass', 'scss', 'txt', 'xhtml', 'xml' ]

# The path to the directory where all generated files will be written to. This
# can be an absolute path starting with a slash, but it can also be path
# relative to the site directory.
output_dir: output

# A list of index filenames, i.e. names of files that will be served by a web
# server when a directory is requested. Usually, index files are named
# “index.html”, but depending on the web server, this may be something else,
# such as “default.htm”. This list is used by nanoc to generate pretty URLs.
index_filenames: [ 'index.html' ]

# Whether or not to generate a diff of the compiled content when compiling a
# site. The diff will contain the differences between the compiled content
# before and after the last site compilation.
enable_output_diff: false

prune:
  # Whether to automatically remove files not managed by nanoc from the output
  # directory. For safety reasons, this is turned off by default.
  auto_prune: false

  # Which files and directories you want to exclude from pruning. If you version
  # your output directory, you should probably exclude VCS directories such as
  # .git, .svn etc.
  exclude: [ '.git', '.hg', '.svn', 'CVS' ]

# The data sources where nanoc loads its data from. This is an array of
# hashes; each array element represents a single data source. By default,
# there is only a single data source that reads data from the “content/” and
# “layout/” directories in the site directory.
data_sources:
  -
    # The type is the identifier of the data source. By default, this will be
    # `filesystem_unified`.
    type: filesystem_unified

    # The path where items should be mounted (comparable to mount points in
    # Unix-like systems). This is “/” by default, meaning that items will have
    # “/” prefixed to their identifiers. If the items root were “/en/”
    # instead, an item at content/about.html would have an identifier of
    # “/en/about/” instead of just “/about/”.
    items_root: /

    # The path where layouts should be mounted. The layouts root behaves the
    # same as the items root, but applies to layouts rather than items.
    layouts_root: /

    # Whether to allow periods in identifiers. When turned off, everything
    # past the first period is considered to be the extension, and when
    # turned on, only the characters past the last period are considered to
    # be the extension. For example,  a file named “content/about.html.erb”
    # will have the identifier “/about/” when turned off, but when turned on
    # it will become “/about.html/” instead.
    allow_periods_in_identifiers: false
